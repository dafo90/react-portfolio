# React Portfolio

My personal [React Portfolio](https://dafo90.github.io) built with React, Material-UI and Redux Toolkit

This website was born in 2019 from my need to learn more deeply and practice with React Hooks, Material-UI and Redux Toolkit, with which I decided to build something useful but simple as a web CV. Any improvements regarding this project is more than welcome, bearing in mind that the main focus is to be able to make it as generic as possible so that any other user could benefit from its use.

1.  Clone the project

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/dafo90/react-portfolio.git
    cd react-portfolio
    ```

2.  Install all necessary dependencies

    ```
    npm install
    ```

3.  Run the application

    ```
    npm start
    ```

4.  To deploy in another GitHub repository (e.g. `https://github.com/<github_username>/<github_username>.github.io.git`
    to have your portfolio in the GitHub Pages' home)

    ```
    echo -e "[remote \"prod\"]\n        url = git@github.com:<github_username>/<github_username>.github.io.git\n        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*" >> .git/config
    ```
