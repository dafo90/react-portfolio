# React Portfolio

My personal [React Portfolio](https://dafo90.github.io) built with React, Material-UI, Redux and Saga

This website was born in 2019 from my need to learn more deeply and practice with React Hooks and Material-UI, with which I decided to build something useful but simple as a web CV. Any improvements regarding this project is more than welcome, bearing in mind that the main focus is to be able to make it as generic as possible so that any other user could benefit as much as possible from its use.

1. Clone the project

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/dafo90/react-portfolio.git
    cd react-portfolio
    ```

2. Install all necessary dependencies

    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the application

    ```
    npm start
    ```
